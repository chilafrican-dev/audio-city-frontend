# Fix: No Difference Between Before/After Mastering

## Problem:
User reports no audible difference between "Before" and "After" mastering modes.

## Potential Causes:

1. **masteredBuffer not synced**: `mastering.js` sets `window.masteredBuffer`, but `mastering.html` uses local `masteredBuffer` variable
2. **Mastering server returning original file**: The server might not be processing correctly
3. **Wrong audio source**: Both modes might be playing the same file

## Investigation Needed:

1. Check console logs - is `masteredBuffer` being set?
2. Check if mastered audio file is different from original
3. Check if playback logic correctly switches between buffers
4. Verify mastering server is actually processing the audio

## Next Steps:

- Check if `window.masteredBuffer` is being synced to local `masteredBuffer`
- Verify the mastered file URL actually contains processed audio
- Test if mastering server is working correctly
