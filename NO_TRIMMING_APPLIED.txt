# Password Trimming Removed - All Passwords Stored/Compared Exactly

## ✅ Changes Applied:

1. **Backend Login (worker-d1.js):**
   - Removed password trimming
   - Passwords compared exactly as stored
   - No backward compatibility checks needed

2. **Backend Signup (worker-d1.js):**
   - Removed password trimming
   - Passwords stored exactly as user types them

3. **Frontend Login (login.html):**
   - Removed password trimming
   - Password sent exactly as typed

4. **Frontend Signup (signup.html):**
   - Already had no trimming
   - Password sent exactly as typed

## 🎯 Result:

- Passwords are stored and compared EXACTLY as the user types them
- No trimming anywhere in the system
- Standard practice - matches how most systems work
- Users can have spaces in passwords if they want

## 🚀 Next Step:

Deploy the updated worker-d1.js to Cloudflare Workers:
```bash
wrangler deploy
```

All accounts should now work with their exact passwords (no trimming).
