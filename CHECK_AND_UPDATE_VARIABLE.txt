# Check and Update MASTERING_SERVER_URL Variable

## If Variable Was Added Before:

If you added `MASTERING_SERVER_URL` before, it's probably set to:
- OLD (temporary): `https://xxxx-xxxx.trycloudflare.com` ❌
- OLD (quick tunnel): `https://talks-pointed-mai-complimentary.trycloudflare.com` ❌

## You Need to Update It To:

- NEW (persistent): `https://mastering.audiocity-ug.com` ✅

## How to Check Current Value:

### Option 1: Cloudflare Dashboard
1. Go to: https://dash.cloudflare.com
2. Workers & Pages → `audio-city-api-d1`
3. Settings → Variables
4. Look for `MASTERING_SERVER_URL`
5. Check what value it has

### Option 2: Check Worker Logs
When a mastering request comes in, the worker logs will show what URL it's trying to use.

## How to Update:

1. Go to: https://dash.cloudflare.com
2. Workers & Pages → `audio-city-api-d1`
3. Settings → Variables
4. Find `MASTERING_SERVER_URL`
5. Click the **pencil/edit icon** (or delete and re-add)
6. Update value to: `https://mastering.audiocity-ug.com`
7. Click **Save**

## Will It Work If Left As Old URL?

❌ **NO** - If it's still set to the old temporary tunnel URL:
- Old quick tunnels expire/change when restarted
- The old URL probably doesn't work anymore
- You'll get connection errors

✅ **YES** - After updating to `https://mastering.audiocity-ug.com`:
- Permanent URL that never changes
- Already configured and working
- Will work forever

## Quick Test:

After updating, the mastering service should work. You can test by:
1. Trying to master a track on your site
2. Check worker logs for any errors
3. The request should go to `https://mastering.audiocity-ug.com/api/quick-master`
