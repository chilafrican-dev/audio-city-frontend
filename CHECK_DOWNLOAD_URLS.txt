# Debug: WAV URL not available

## Issue:
User clicks download button but gets "WAV URL not available yet"

## Check:
1. Is `window.downloadUrls` being set correctly in mastering.js?
2. Is `getWavUrl()` checking `window.downloadUrls`?
3. Are download buttons being enabled at the right time?
4. Is there a timing issue - buttons enabled before URLs are set?

## Next Steps:
- Check console logs to see if downloadUrls is set
- Verify getWavUrl() is checking window.downloadUrls
- Check if download buttons are enabled before URLs are available
