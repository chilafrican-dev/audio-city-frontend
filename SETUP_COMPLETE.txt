# ✅ Cloudflare Worker Setup Complete!

## What's Done:

### 1. Worker Deployed ✅
- **URL**: https://audio-city-api-proxy.chilafrican.workers.dev
- **Name**: audio-city-api-proxy
- **Status**: Active and running

### 2. Backend URL Configured ✅
- **Secret Set**: BACKEND_URL = https://api.audiocity-ug.com
- Worker will proxy requests to this URL

### 3. Frontend Updated ✅
- All 23 HTML files updated
- Now using: https://audio-city-api-proxy.chilafrican.workers.dev
- Localhost still works for development

## Current Architecture:

```
Frontend (audiocity-ug.com)
    ↓
Cloudflare Worker (Proxy)
    ↓
Backend API (api.audiocity-ug.com) ← NEEDS HTTPS
```

## Next Step: Deploy Backend with HTTPS

Your backend API must be accessible at:
**https://api.audiocity-ug.com**

### Option 1: Deploy to VPS with HTTPS
1. Deploy backend to 168.119.241.59
2. Set up Nginx with Let's Encrypt SSL
3. Configure DNS: api.audiocity-ug.com → VPS IP

### Option 2: Use Cloudflare Tunnel
1. Install cloudflared on backend server
2. Create tunnel to localhost:3002
3. Point api.audiocity-ug.com to tunnel

### Option 3: Other Hosting
- Railway, Render, Fly.io, etc.
- Must support HTTPS

## Test Connection:

Once backend is deployed:
```bash
curl https://audio-city-api-proxy.chilafrican.workers.dev/api/health
```

Should return backend health status.

## Files Updated:
- All *.html files (23 files)
- worker.js (deployed)
- wrangler.workers.toml (config)

## Summary:
✅ Worker deployed and configured
✅ Frontend connected to worker
⏳ Backend needs HTTPS deployment
