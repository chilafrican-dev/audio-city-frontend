# Check Deployed Worker Response Format

## Issue:
After deploying, still getting "Mastering request failed" error

## The Problem:

The mastering server (on VPS) returns a synchronous response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "preset": "...",
  "input": {...},
  "output": {...},
  "gain": ...,
  "downloads": {
    "wav": "/output/...",
    "mp3": "/output/..."
  }
}
```

But the frontend expects:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "jobId": "..." OR "progressId": "..."
}
```

OR for completed:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "status": "completed",
  "audioUrl": "...",
  ...
}
```

## The Worker Code Should Transform It:

Looking at worker-d1.js lines 2993-3013, it should transform synchronous responses. But there might be an issue with the transformation logic.

## Let's Check:

1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Try mastering again
4. Click on the `/api/quick-master` request
5. Check the "Response" tab - what does it actually return?

This will tell us if:
- The worker is transforming correctly
- The server is responding
- The format matches what's expected
