# Password Change Security - Safe for All Users ✅

## Security Checks in Place:

1. **User Authentication Required:**
   - Must be logged in with valid token
   - Line 618-619: Verifies token and gets current user

2. **Own Account Only:**
   - Line 621: `if (!currentUser || currentUser.id !== userId)`
   - Users can ONLY change their own password
   - If they try to change someone else's password → Returns "Unauthorized" (401)

3. **Old Password Verification:**
   - Line 627-628: Verifies old password matches before allowing change
   - Prevents unauthorized password changes even if someone has your token

4. **Specific User Update:**
   - Line 636-638: `UPDATE users SET password = ? WHERE id = ?`
   - Only updates the specific user's password (the one in the URL)
   - Cannot affect other users' passwords

## What This Means:

✅ **Safe for all users** - Each user can only change their own password
✅ **No disruption** - Other users' accounts are completely unaffected
✅ **Secure** - Multiple security checks prevent unauthorized changes
✅ **Isolated** - Each password change is independent

## Example:

- User A (ID: 123) can only change password for user ID 123
- User B (ID: 456) can only change password for user ID 456
- If User A tries to change User B's password → Blocked with "Unauthorized"

## Conclusion:

This endpoint is **100% safe** and will **NOT disrupt other users' accounts**.
