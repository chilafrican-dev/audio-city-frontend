# Sync mastering.js Files - Avoid Confusion

## Problem:
There are TWO mastering.js files:
1. `/mastering.js` (root) - 327 lines
2. `/cloudflare-frontend/mastering.js` - 456 lines

Both HTML files reference `mastering.js` (relative path), which causes confusion about which one is actually being used.

## Solution Options:

### Option 1: Use Only cloudflare-frontend Version (Recommended)
Since you're using cloudflare-frontend, copy the updated cloudflare-frontend/mastering.js to root:

```bash
cp cloudflare-frontend/mastering.js mastering.js
```

### Option 2: Delete Root Version
If you only use cloudflare-frontend, delete the root version:

```bash
rm mastering.js
```

### Option 3: Keep Both in Sync
Always update both files when making changes (current approach).

## Recommendation:
Since you're deploying via Cloudflare, use Option 1 - copy the cloudflare-frontend version to root to ensure consistency.
