# VMSocket SSH Key Troubleshooting

## Issue:
SSH connection works, but key authentication fails.

## Possible Solutions:

### 1. Check Key Format in VMSocket
- Go to vmsocket.com/keys
- Verify the key was added correctly
- Some systems require key WITHOUT the comment (last part)
- Try adding just: ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIHzLTUgcZovbKKpH55SmCi8/aO74yxomMIGmCTOMGVy/

### 2. Verify Key is Active
- Check if key shows as "active" or "enabled" in VMSocket
- Some providers need to "activate" keys after adding

### 3. Check VMSocket Documentation
- Look for SSH key setup instructions
- Some providers have specific requirements

### 4. Contact VMSocket Support
- Ask them to verify the key was added correctly
- Request root password as temporary solution
- Ask for alternative deployment method

### 5. Alternative: Use Existing Key
If you have the private key file matching:
  ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAINf+lrHy+LXSnqO9ZaYaNEhG4D/buGYHsvwn3SJ9RHFY

I can use that instead.
