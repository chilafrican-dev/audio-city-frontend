# Login System Changes History

## What Changed:

1. **Originally (Working):**
   - Login compared passwords exactly as stored (no trimming)
   - Password: "Semakulanico1" worked fine

2. **Recent Changes (Broke Login):**
   - Added password trimming to login endpoint
   - Added password trimming to signup endpoint
   - This broke ALL existing accounts because:
     * Old passwords stored: "Semakulanico1" (no trimming)
     * New login code trimmed: "Semakulanico1" → "Semakulanico1" (same, but logic changed)
     * Actually, the issue was we were trimming on login but passwords weren't trimmed when stored

3. **Attempted Fix:**
   - Added backward compatibility (check both trimmed and untrimmed)
   - This was a workaround

4. **Current State:**
   - Removed ALL trimming (back to original)
   - Passwords compared exactly as stored

## The Problem:

If your password "Semakulanico1" was working before, it should work now.
But if we changed the login logic and the worker wasn't deployed, you might be hitting the OLD code.

## Solution:

1. Check if password in database matches exactly what you're typing
2. Make sure the updated worker is deployed
3. The current code (no trimming) should work with your original password
