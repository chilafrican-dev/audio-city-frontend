# URGENT: Clear Cloudflare Cache NOW

## The Error is Still Showing Because Cloudflare is Serving Cached Files

Even in incognito mode, Cloudflare's edge cache is serving old JavaScript files.

## IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:

### Step 1: Purge Cloudflare Cache
1. Go to: https://dash.cloudflare.com
2. Select domain: **audiocity-ug.com**
3. Click **"Caching"** → **"Configuration"**
4. Click **"Purge Everything"** button
5. **WAIT 2-3 MINUTES** for propagation

### Step 2: Verify Deployment
Check if your latest code is deployed:
- Go to: https://github.com/chilafrican-dev/audio-city-frontend
- Check if latest commits are pushed
- If using Cloudflare Pages, check deployment status

### Step 3: Force Browser to Skip Cache
After purging Cloudflare cache:

1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to **Network** tab
3. **CHECK** the box: **"Disable cache"**
4. Keep DevTools open
5. Reload page (F5)

### Step 4: Verify New Code Loaded
In browser console, you should see:
```
🎛️ Mastering module initialized
```

If you DON'T see this, the new mastering.js file isn't loading.

### Step 5: Check Network Tab
Look for `mastering.js?v=20241230-3` in the Network tab.
- If you see `mastering.js` WITHOUT the version parameter, it's cached
- If you see `mastering.js?v=20241230-3`, it's the new version

## Alternative: Bypass Cloudflare Cache Temporarily

Add this to the URL to bypass cache:
```
https://audiocity-ug.com/mastering?nocache=1234567890
```

## If Still Not Working:

The issue might be that Cloudflare Pages hasn't deployed the latest code yet. Check:
1. GitHub repository for latest commits
2. Cloudflare Pages deployment status
3. Make sure `mastering.js` file exists in the repository
