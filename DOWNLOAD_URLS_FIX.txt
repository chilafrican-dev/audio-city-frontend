# Fixed: Download URLs Not Showing

## Problem:
- Mastering was working ✅
- Audio was loading for preview ✅
- But download URLs showed as `null` ❌
- Error: "WAV URL not available yet"

## Root Cause:
The `getWavUrl()` and `getAudioUrl()` functions in `mastering.html` were reading from the local `downloadUrls` variable, but `mastering.js` was setting `window.downloadUrls`. They weren't synced!

## Fix Applied:

1. ✅ Updated `getWavUrl()` to check `window.downloadUrls` first
2. ✅ Updated `getAudioUrl()` to check `window.downloadUrls` first  
3. ✅ Updated console.log to show `window.downloadUrls`
4. ✅ Synced both mastering.html files

## Result:

Now when `mastering.js` sets `window.downloadUrls`, the helper functions will find it and download buttons will work!

## Test:

After deploying, try mastering again - the download buttons should now work correctly.
