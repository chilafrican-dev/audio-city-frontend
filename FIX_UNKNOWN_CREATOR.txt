# Fixed "Unknown Creator" on Feed ✅

## Problem:
- Feed was showing "Unknown Creator" for tracks
- Backend wasn't returning `artist_name` field
- Frontend was using fallback "Unknown Creator"

## Solution:

1. **Backend (worker-d1.js):**
   - Added `u.name as artist_name` to track queries
   - Now returns both `artist_username` and `artist_name`
   - Updated both:
     * GET /api/tracks (list of tracks)
     * GET /api/tracks/:id (single track)

2. **Frontend (feed.html):**
   - Changed fallback from "Unknown Creator" to "Creator"
   - Uses `artist_name` first, then `artist_username` as fallback
   - Better fallback chain: `artist_name || artist_username || 'Creator'`

## Changes Made:

**Backend Query:**
```sql
-- Before:
SELECT t.*, u.username as artist_username, ...

-- After:
SELECT t.*, u.username as artist_username, u.name as artist_name, ...
```

**Frontend Display:**
```javascript
// Before:
userName: track.artist_name || 'Unknown Creator'

// After:
userName: track.artist_name || track.artist_username || 'Creator'
```

## Result:

✅ Tracks now show actual artist names
✅ Falls back to username if name not available
✅ Shows "Creator" instead of "Unknown Creator" (less negative)
✅ Works for both feed list and single track pages

## Next Steps:

1. Deploy updated worker-d1.js
2. Refresh feed page
3. Should see actual artist names instead of "Unknown Creator"
