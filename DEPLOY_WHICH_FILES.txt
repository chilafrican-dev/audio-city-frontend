# Which Files to Deploy - Clear Answer

## For Cloudflare Pages/Frontend:

**Deploy the `cloudflare-frontend/` folder**

This includes:
- ✅ `cloudflare-frontend/mastering.html`
- ✅ `cloudflare-frontend/mastering.js` (the one we just updated)
- ✅ All other HTML files in that folder

## Why cloudflare-frontend?

1. **Cloudflare Pages** typically deploys from a specific directory
2. The `cloudflare-frontend/` folder is your production frontend
3. The root `mastering.html` and `mastering.js` are likely for local development

## Deployment Steps:

### If using Cloudflare Pages Dashboard:
1. Go to: https://dash.cloudflare.com
2. Pages → Your project
3. Make sure it's set to deploy from `cloudflare-frontend/` directory
4. Deploy (or it auto-deploys on git push)

### If using Git:
- Push changes to your repository
- Cloudflare Pages will auto-deploy from `cloudflare-frontend/`

### If deploying manually:
- Upload the entire `cloudflare-frontend/` folder
- Make sure `mastering.js` is in that folder

## Summary:

✅ **Deploy**: `cloudflare-frontend/mastering.js` (and all files in cloudflare-frontend/)
❌ **Don't deploy**: Root `mastering.js` (that's just synced for consistency)

The root files are synced to avoid confusion, but the actual deployment should use `cloudflare-frontend/`.
