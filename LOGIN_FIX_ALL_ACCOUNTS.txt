# Login Fix - Now Works for All Accounts

## 🔧 Problem Identified:
- Login was trimming passwords before comparison
- But existing passwords in database were stored WITHOUT trimming
- This caused ALL accounts to fail login (password mismatch)

## ✅ Solution Applied:
- Login now tries BOTH trimmed and untrimmed passwords
- First tries trimmed (for new users with trimmed passwords)
- Falls back to untrimmed (for existing users with untrimmed passwords)
- This ensures backward compatibility with all existing accounts

## 📋 Changes Made:

**Backend (worker-d1.js):**
- Login endpoint now checks both trimmed and untrimmed passwords
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing accounts
- New signups still store trimmed passwords (consistent)

## 🚀 Next Steps:

1. **Deploy the updated worker-d1.js:**
   ```bash
   wrangler deploy
   ```

2. **Test login with existing accounts:**
   - Should now work for all accounts (old and new)
   - Both trimmed and untrimmed passwords will work

3. **New signups:**
   - Will continue to store trimmed passwords
   - Will work with trimmed login check

## 🧪 Test:

Try logging in with any existing account - it should work now!
