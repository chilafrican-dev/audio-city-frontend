# Verify MASTERING_SERVER_URL is Set to Persistent URL

## ✅ Correct Value (Persistent):

**Variable Name**: `MASTERING_SERVER_URL`  
**Value**: `https://mastering.audiocity-ug.com`

This is the persistent URL that:
- ✅ Never changes
- ✅ Works permanently
- ✅ Already configured on your server
- ✅ DNS is already set up

## ❌ Old Values (Temporary - Don't Use):

- `https://xxxx-xxxx.trycloudflare.com` (any trycloudflare.com URL)
- `https://talks-pointed-mai-complimentary.trycloudflare.com`
- `https://verification-maintain-info-sell.trycloudflare.com`
- `http://43.245.227.33:3001` (direct IP - won't work from Workers)

## How to Check Current Value:

1. Go to: https://dash.cloudflare.com
2. Workers & Pages → `audio-city-api-d1`
3. Settings → Variables
4. Look for `MASTERING_SERVER_URL`
5. Check the value

## If It's Already Set Correctly:

✅ If it's already set to `https://mastering.audiocity-ug.com` → **You're done!** It will work.

## If It's Set to Old/Temporary URL:

❌ Update it to: `https://mastering.audiocity-ug.com`

Steps:
1. Click edit/pencil icon on the variable
2. Change value to: `https://mastering.audiocity-ug.com`
3. Save

## Summary:

- **Persistent URL**: `https://mastering.audiocity-ug.com` ✅
- **Status**: Already working (we tested it)
